              "When I arrived home from hospital my son would only last about 5
              minutes in his crib without crying. I then remembered about the
              purflo nest I had purchased and as if by magic I finally managed
              to get my son to sleep in his cot. I can't believe how well this
              product worked. He loved sleeping in it and looked so snug and
              cosy.absolute a must for a newborn."

              comfortable that he snuggles into the nest.I always felt he was
              safe in the nest as he could roll anywhere. Even if visitors were
              visiting we would leave the baby in there and they would hold the
