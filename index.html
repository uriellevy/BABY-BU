              "When I arrived home from hospital my son would only last about 5 minutes in his crib without crying. I then remembered about the purflo nest I had purchased and as if by magic I finally managed to get my son to sleep in his cot. I can't believe how well this product worked. He loved sleeping in it and looked so snug and cosy.absolute a must for a newborn."

              "We were gifted this nest on the birth of our son. He absolutely loved it and we would take it whenever we were visiting friends and family. He's about to turn 6 months and he still finds it so comfortable that he snuggles into the nest.I always felt he was safe in the nest as he could roll anywhere. Even if visitors were visiting we would leave the baby in there and they would hold the nest so he's comfortable"

              "The Baby-Bu is a great sleep pod, which we have used for daytime sleeping. Baby is comfy, cosy and sleeps really well. The mesh is supportive yet breathable and the sides are lovely and padded. Not too heavy so can be carried upstairs and down for daytime sleeping. The cover is really easy to take off, wash and put back on. Just wish it had a handle!"
